        This privacy policy for <a href="https://ctf.anonymized.net">ctf.anonymized.net</a> ("I", "me", "my", "we," "us," or

        collect, store, use, and/or share ("process") your information when you use our services ("Services"), such as
        when you:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">Visit our website at <a href="https://ctf.anonymized.net">https://ctf.anonymized.net</a>,

    <h3>Summary of key points</h3>
    <p>When you visit, use, or navigate our Services, we may process personal
        information depending on how you interact with us and the Services, the choices you make, and
        features you use.</p>
    <p>We do not process sensitive personal information. We do not receive any information from third parties.</p>
    <p>We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services,
        communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your
        information for other purposes with your consent. We process your information only when we have a valid legal
        reason
        to do so.</p>
    <p>We have organizational and technical processes and procedures in place to
        protect your personal information. However, no electronic transmission over the internet or information storage
        technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or
        other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal,
        or
        modify your information.</p>
    <p>Depending on where you are located geographically, the applicable privacy law may mean you
        have certain rights regarding your personal information.</p>
    <p>The easiest way to exercise your rights is by
        contacting me. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

    <h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
    <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an
        interest in obtaining information about me or otherwise when you contact me.</p>
    <p>We do not process sensitive information.</p>
    <p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of
        any
        changes to such personal information.</p>
    <h4>Information automatically collected</h4>
    <p>In Short: Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device
        characteristics —
        is collected automatically when you visit our Services.</p>
    <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does
        not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage
        information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language
        preferences,
        referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other
        technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our
        Services,
        and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
    The information we collect includes:
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and
            performance information our
            servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files.
            Depending on how
            you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and
            settings and
            information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage,
            pages and
            files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information
            (such
            as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Device Data. We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone,
            tablet, or other device you use
            to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your
            IP
            address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware
            model,
            Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's
            location, which can be either
            precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use
            to
            access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that
            tells us
            your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information
            either
            by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you
            choose
            to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How do we process your information?</h3>
    <p>We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for
        security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes
        with
        your consent.</p>
    <p>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services,
        including:</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">We may process your information as part of our efforts to keep our Services safe and
            secure, including fraud monitoring and prevention.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">We may process information about how you use our Services to better understand how
            they are being used so we can improve them.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual's
            vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What legal bases do we rely on to process your information?</h3>
    <p>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason
        (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you
        with
        services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our
        legitimate
        business interests.</p>
    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on
        in
        order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your
        personal information:</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to
            use your personal
            information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing
            your
            consent.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to
            achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental
            rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes
            described in order to:</li>
        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain
                users
            <li class="list-group-item">Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</li>
        </ul>
        <li class="list-group-item">We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with
            our legal
            obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our
            legal
            rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your
            vital interests or
            the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any
            person.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When and with whom do we share your personal information?</h3>
    <p>We may do not share information with third parties.</p>

    <h3>How long do we keep your information?</h3>
    <p>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice
        unless otherwise required by law.</p>
    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
        privacy
        notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
        legal
        requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the
        period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
        anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
        stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
        further
        processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <h3>How do we keep your information safe?</h3>
    <p>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security
        measures.</p>
    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect
        the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to
        be
        100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties
        will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
        Although
        we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

    <h3>Do we collect information from minors?</h3>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>
    <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you
        represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such
        minor
        dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has
        been
        collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our
        records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
        privacy@umami.is.</p>

    <h3>What are your privacy rights?</h3>
    <p>In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA)
        you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review,
        change,
        or terminate your account at any time.
    </p>
    <p> In some regions (like the EEA), you have certain rights under applicable data
        protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
        information,
        (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if
        applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain
        circumstances,
        you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a
        request by
        contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "How can you contact us about this notice?"
        below.</p>
    <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
    <p>If you are located in the EEA and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also
        have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority.</p>
    <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be
        express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at
        any
        time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the
        section How can you contact us about this notice?" below.</p>
    <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when
        applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
        lawful
        processing grounds other than consent.</p>
    <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email me at <a
            href="mailto:ANONYMIZED" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ANONYMIZED</a></p>

    <h3>Controls for Do-Not-Track features</h3>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
        feature
        or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
        activities
        monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
        signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do currently respond on a best-effort basis to DNT browser signals or any other
        mechanism that
        automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
        that
        we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
        notice.</p>

    <h3>Do we make updates to this notice?</h3>
    <p>Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>
    <p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
        "Revised"
        date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this
        privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes. We encourage you to
        review
        this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>


    <h3>How can you contact us about this notice?</h3>
